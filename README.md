# Flowbeya — A Game About Flow in Teams
Flowbeya is a browser-based interactive narrative game designed to teach and provoke discussion around flow, delivery metrics, and team experimentation in a lightweight, engaging way. Built in Twine, the game lets players explore choices and see how those decisions impact key flow metrics like Throughput, Cycle Time, Work in Progress, and Work Item Age.

## 🧠 What’s It About?
Flowbeya simulates a team environment where you, the player, are responsible for guiding your team’s process improvement journey. You'll be introduced to delivery flow metrics and given multiple opportunities to experiment with changes — from introducing focus time to tweaking your Definition of Done.

The goal? Help your team flow better.
