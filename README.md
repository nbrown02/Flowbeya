# Twine for Flow Metrics

## General Design
* Users start the game with the four flow metrics (Throughput, Cycle Time, Work In Progress (WIP) and Work Item Age
  
* User has to try improve a team (through their flow metrics) via running different experiments
  
* Some experiments work, some do not, some also take time to come to fruition
  
* User get the chance to repeat the experiment or try something new to improve the metrics further
  
* If they try attempt an experiment more than four times they get redirected to a new list of experiments to choose from
  
* The metrics reflect every 2 weeks, running a total of 6 possible experiments (or 6 experiment 'cycles')
  
* At the end, the user is presented with summary metrics for how they've improved the four flow metrics
