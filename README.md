# Twine for Flow Metrics

## General Design
- Users view a pinboard with the four flow metrics
- User chooses a metric and picks from 'experiments' to improve the metric
- Some experiments work, some do not
- User get the chance to run another experiment to improve the metric further
- If they try attempt another (third experiment) they get redirected to focus on a different metric, as they should be trying to balance them

## Current version
- Has a Flow Metrics landing page
- This can click through to any of the four charts
- There is an end-to-end journey for the Throughput metric
- Placeholder images for Throughput charts (using Medium blog post)
- You can also click through to a help page which links to an external email (currently my personal email)
