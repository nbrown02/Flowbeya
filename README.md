# Twine for Flow Metrics

## General Design
* Users view a pinboard with the four flow metrics
* User chooses a metric and picks from 'experiments' to improve the metric
* Some experiments work, some do not
* User get the chance to run another experiment to improve the metric further
* If they try attempt another (third experiment) they get redirected to focus on a different metric, as they should be trying to balance them

## Current version
* Has a Flow Metrics landing page - this can click through to any of the four charts
* There is an end-to-end journey for the Throughput metric, albeit with placeholder images for Throughput charts (using those from the Medium blog post)
* You can also click through to a help page which links to an external email (currently my personal email)

## Still to do
* Add proper images for charts showing impact of experiments
* <strike>Add NBS logo</strike>
* <strike>Change background to be white not black</strike>
* Add NBS styling, 
  - <strike>Navy Header (#002878)</strike>
  - <strike>Grey Body (#5b6063)</strike>
  - NBS-medium font
  - <strike>Navy links, red on hover (#dc291e)</strike>
  - <strike>White background (#fff)</strike>
